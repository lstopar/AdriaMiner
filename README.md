QMiner
======

QMiner is an analytics platform for large-scale data stores and real-time streams containing
structured and unstructured data. It is designed to for scaling to millions of instances on
high-end commodity hardware, providing efficient storage, retrieval and analytics mechanisms
with real-time response.

The goal is not to replace the traditional relation databases (e.g. MS SQL Server, Oracle, 
MySQL), but to enable or make affordable scenarios not possible so far within traditional setups.

The development is mostly aligned based on requirements from projects, which are using QMiner, 
and roughly follows the roadmap.
